It was originally 'discovered' to be a great weekend or daytrip destination in the early 1950s, allegedly by sun starved German residents of Manila. In fact the German Club had a cottage there then. It was soon a popular target for holiday lovers and permanent cottages (even deluxe beach houses) were built along the beach line (and some into the beach) in the early 1960s for rich Manila folk.]]></item>

The fish are rubbed with salt, covered in dried kamias, and then placed in a clay pot. Through slow cooking, the flavor of the fish oozes out and mixes with the water, which we call 'patis' (fish sauce). Itâs salty and very, well, fishy. Itâs a favorite among Batanguenos for its long shelf life even without refrigeration.]]></item>

Itâs a way of prolonging the âshelf lifeâ of the fish. You can find tinapa in any market in Batangas. If youâre stopping by soon, donât forget to buy a pack and take it home.
